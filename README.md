# Casanode BLE

Application for Bluetooth communication between phone and casanode node.

## Installation

### Docker (Rootless Mode on Raspberry Pi)
Docker must be run in rootless mode on Raspberry Pi to ensure the proper functioning of the development environment. This guarantees that all files created by containers remain under the control of the current user and that the application runs smoothly.

#### Install Docker in rootless mode

1. **Log in as a non-root user** (e.g. `raspberry`):
   ```bash
   su - raspberry
   ```

2. **Download and install rootless Docker**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/rootless | sh
   ```

3. **Update environment variables**  
   Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
   export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/docker.sock
   ```

   Then reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Start the Docker daemon**:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user start docker
   systemctl --user enable docker
   ```

5. **Check that Docker is running in rootless mode**:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

#### Notes

- Containers launched as root will not be visible in rootless mode.
- Files and volumes will be owned by the current user.
- Binding to ports below 1024 may require additional configuration.
- This setup is ideal for single-user devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Web server

The application listens to two network ports, one in HTTP that gives access to the QR Code connection and the other in HTTPS to enable requests to the REST APIs.

### Configuration

The parameters used to configure the web server are in the `/etc/casanode.conf` configuration file:

- `WEB_LISTEN`: Interface and listening port for the QR Code display page (in HTTP)
- `API_LISTEN`: Interface and listening port for APIs (in HTTPS)
- `API_AUTH`: Authentication token for using APIs

### Testing REST APIs

The commands below are examples of how to test the API. Replace the `<token>` with the value available in the `/etc/casanode.conf` configuration file in the `API_AUTH` attribute.

## Bluetooth Communication

### Requirements

Install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
	python3-dotenv \
	python3-dbus \
	python3-psutil \
	python3-pip \
	python3-venv \
	python3-gi \
	python3-gi-cairo \
	libcairo2-dev \
	libgirepository1.0-dev \
	libdbus-1-dev \
	libbluetooth-dev \
	bluez
```

### Enable Bluetooth Experimental Mode

Edit the Bluetooth service to enable experimental features:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's|ExecStart=/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd|ExecStart=/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd --experimental|' /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### User Permissions

Add your user to the `bluetooth` group and to the `sudoers` group if needed:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG bluetooth $USER
sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER
```

Log out and log back in for group changes to take effect.

## Generating .deb Packages

The creation of the .deb package is done in a Docker container. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the container by running the `deb-build.sh` bash script available at the root of the project.
2. Once the container is started, execute the `build.sh` script.
3. To send the .deb file to the GitHub repository, use the `deb-push.sh` bash script (outside the container) available at the root of the project. This script clones a repository and sends everything to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.

## Tests

Node tests are located in `app/tests` and can be executed with:

```bash
cd app
npm test
```

Python tests reside in `ble/tests` and can be run using Pytest:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ble pytest
```
